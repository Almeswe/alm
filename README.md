## About

 alm - is the simple functional programming language, with **self writed front-end** and using **MSIL like back-end**.
 
 The main purpose of this project is to **reach experience** in compiler design and finally **understand how really this all things work**, no more.
 
 I know that it's the thousandth implementation of compiler and it will be useless for most community, but i think that someday, for somebody, it may be useful.
 
 And so i leave it here, why not.

## Installation

 ### Requirements
  * **.NET 4+**
  
 Open the latest release (or simply [click](https://github.com/Almeswe/alm/releases/download/v.2.0.0/almc.v.2.0.0.zip) here) and download the zip with libs,tests and binary.
 
 Note that the 'libs' folder and the binary file(compiler) must located together, also i recommend you to not rename it, otherwise imports will work wrong.
  
 
## Usage
 Specifically for this task i created the '?' shell command which will show you all commands ant their definitions.
 
 But i also want to share you here some recomendations for comfortable use.
 
 The example algorithm for first use (with commands):
  * Open compiler's shell 
  * **> crfl "main.alm"**
  * **> opfl this** 
  * write some code
  * **> c 1 "test.exe"**
  * after this you may use only **'rec'** command for recompiling
     
 Other detailed information you may see after typing '?' command:
  * **> ?**
